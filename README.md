A basic stopwatch is a simple timing device used to measure elapsed time. It typically features a digital or analog display with start, stop, and reset buttons. 

Hereâ€™s a basic overview:

- **Start Button**: Begins timing when pressed.
- **Stop Button**: Halts the timing process, allowing you to see the elapsed time.
- **Reset Button**: Clears the elapsed time and returns the stopwatch to zero.

Digital stopwatches display time in hours, minutes, seconds, and fractions of a second, while analog stopwatches have a dial with moving hands. They are commonly used in sports, cooking, and various activities where precise timing is needed.
